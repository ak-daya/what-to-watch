The first file needed for this research is titled movies.csv.

The second dataset was used to augment the first, but is too large. It can be downloaded from IMDb's data repo:
IMDb movie-language metadata dataset (https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.akas.tsv.gz)
- associates a movie with its language. These datasets can then be merged on rows where language = english.
